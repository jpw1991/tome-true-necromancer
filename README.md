# True Necromancer

This is a mod for Tales of Maj'Eyal that adds a new class to the game called
the `True Necromancer`. I was disappointed with the vanilla necromancer because
a summoning build is unfortunately quite weak. This mod seeks to address that issue.

This mod does not replace the Necromancer class. It simply adds a new class called the `True Necromancer` to the game.

## Brief Description

Unlike the vanilla Necromancer, the True Necromancer has fewer direct attacks of his own and has to rely on
his minions to deal damage. Without his minions, he is helpless and pitiful. But with them, he's terrifying.

## Install
Copy the `tome-true-necromancer` folder to your addons folder. On windows, this is something like:
`D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\TalesMajEyal\game\addons`

## Features

** Warning: The following may change as I develop and balance the mod **

The class has no access to the following Necromancer talent categories:
- Animus
- Grave
- Necrotic Minions
- Nightfall
- Advanced Necrotic Minions
- Shades

These talents categories are replaced by the following ones:

| Type | Name | Locked | Talent1 | Talent2 | Talent3 | Talent4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spell | Skeletal Minions | No | Summon Skeleton Warrior | Summon Skeleton Archer | Summon Skeleton Mage | Skeleton Mastery |
| Spell | Fleshy Minions | No | Summon Ghouls | Summon Golem | Summon Mummies | Fleshy Mastery |
| Spell | Dark Mastery | No | Minion Strength | Minion Resistance | Soul Reserve | Dark Sacrifice |
| Spell | Dark Utility | Yes | Considerate Minions | Dark Recall | Necrotic Frenzy | Detonate Minions |

Skeleton minions tend to be of a higher quality than fleshy minions, but can only be summoned one at a time. Fleshy minions tend to be of a lower quality than skeleton minions, but they're cheaper and can be summoned in bulk.

Talent descriptions:

| Category | Talent | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skeletal Minions | Summon Skeleton Warrior | Summons a skeleton warrior (warrior minion limit and level raised by each level). |
|  | Summon Skeleton Archer | Summon a skeleton archer (archer minion limit and level raised by each level). |
|  | Summon Skeleton Mages | Summon a skeleton mage (mage minion limit and level raised by each level). |
|  | Skeleton Mastery | Improves the quality of skeleton minions. |
| Fleshy Minions | Summon Ghoul | Summons ghouls (ghoul minion limit and level raised by each level). |
|  | Summon Golem | Summon a bone golem (maximum of two at top level). Requires no souls, only mana. |
|  | Summon Mummies | Summons mummies (mummy minion limit and level raised by each level). |
|  | Fleshy Mastery | Improves the quality of fleshy minions summoned. |
| Dark Mastery | Minion Strength | Improves the level of the minions summoned by all True Necromancer summoning abilities. |
|  | Minion Resistance | Each level improves all the resistances of your minions by 10%. |
|  | Soul Reserve | Increases soul capacity by 5 per level, adds a 15% chance of a soul being refunded to you when a minion dies per level. |
|  | Dark Sacrifice | A portion of the caster's life is sacrificed to generate a soul, starting at 75% at level 1 and ending at 25% at max level. |
| Dark Utility | Considerate Minions | The necromancer's Dark Empathy ability, just renamed and put in this category BUT with the following difference: Friendly fire protection extends to minions themselves too (no more friendly fire from mages). |
|  | Dark Recall | The necromancer's Shadow Tunnel ability, just renamed and put in this category. |
|  | Necrotic Frenzy | The necromancer's Surge of Undeath ability, just renamed and put in this category. |
|  | Minion Explosion | The necromancer's Undead Explosion ability, just renamed and put in this category. |

## Inspiration for the mod
I feel like there hasn't been a truly satisfying summoning experience in a game since Diablo 2.
Tales of Maj'Eyal is a masterpiece and came so close to giving me what I wanted, but even then,
not quite. So I decided to fix that.

### Skeletal Minions
The `Skeletal Minions` category offers strong units with clearly defined roles. This offers a broad spread of utility and allows
a necromancer to bring a tailor made force for any situation. Skeletal minions can only be summmoned one at a time, making the
replementishment of your army harder if units are rapidly being killed off. This category is for the summoner who likes to prepare
the perfect unit composition before heading into battle or for the summoner who loves skeletons.

Skeleton warriors form a capable and resilient frontline. Skeleton archers excel at dealing strong ranged damage without friendly fire.
Skeleton mages devastate the enemy with powerful magical attacks.

### Fleshy Minions
The `Fleshy Minions` category offers a mixture of versatile units that can be summoned in bulk.

Ghouls form a resilient yet expendable frontline, golems serve a strange mixture of tank and artillery roles as they soak up damage
with their shields and shower the enemy in projectiles. Mummies are strong in any situation as they have a lot of constitution and
can use their hatred to summon shadows and smite your enemies with willful strikes.

The `Fleshy Minions` is intended to offer less quality but more convenience. Troops can be summoned in bursts
and can therefore be replenished more easily, making investing some points in this category useful for emergency
situations.

### Dark Mastery
The `Dark Mastery` category allows you to improve the strength and resilience of all your minions. It also allows you to store more
souls in reserve and allows you to transform your own health into souls in case you ever run out.

### Dark Utility
The `Dark utility` category allows you allows to improve, enhance and utilise your minions in various useful ways.

## Additional Notes

**Important**: Please note that the rewards of this class are reaped from maxing out skills. Minions will be weak until fully skilled. You can summon both fleshy and skeletal minions but I recommend that you max out whatever minions you want to use (5/5 skill points invested) otherwise your minions will be weak. The `Fleshy Mastery` and `Skeletal Mastery` skills are especially important for getting high quality minions.

## To do

- `Considerate Minions` should stop friendly fire from minions to each other.

## Known Issues/Bugs

None.
