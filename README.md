# True Necromancer

This is a mod for Tales of Maj'Eyal that adds a new class to the game called
the `True Necromancer`. I was disappointed with the vanilla necromancer because
a summoning build is unfortunately quite weak. This mod seeks to address that issue.

This mod does not replace the Necromancer class. It simply adds a new class called the `True Necromancer` to the game.

## Brief Description

Unlike the vanilla Necromancer, the True Necromancer has fewer direct attacks of his own and has to rely on
his minions to deal damage. Without his minions, he is as helpless and pitiful. But with them, he's terrifying.

## Features

** Warning: The following may change as I balance the mod **

The class has no access to the following Necromancer talent categories:
- Animus
- Grave
- Necrotic Minions
- Nightfall
- Advanced Necrotic Minions
- Shades

These talents categories are replaced by the following ones:

| Type | Name | Locked | Talents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Name | Locked | Talent1 | Talent2 | Talent3 | Talent4 |
| Spell | Skeletal Minions | No | Summon Skeleton Warrior | Summon Skeleton Archer | Summon Skeleton Mage | Skeleton Mastery |
| Spell | Fleshy Minions | No | Summon Ghouls | Summon Vampires | Summon Golem | Fleshy Mastery |
| Spell | Dark Mastery | No | Minion Strength | True Aura Mastery | Soul Reserve | Dark Sacrifice |
| Spell | Terrifying Minions | Yes | Summon Wight | Summon Dread | Summon Lich |  |
| Spell | Dark Utility | Yes | Dark Recall | Minion Explosion | Necrotic Frenzy | Considerate Minions |

Skeleton minions tend to be of a higher quality than fleshy minions, but can only be summoned one at a time. Fleshy minions tend to be of a lower quality than skeleton minions, but they're cheaper and can be summoned in bulk.

Talent descriptions:

| Category | Talent | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skeletal Minions | Summon Skeleton Warriors | Summons a skeleton warrior (warrior capacity raised by each level). |
|  | Summon Skeleton Archers | Summon a skeleton archer (archer capacity raised by each level). |

| Dark Mastery | Minion Strength | Improves the strength of the minions summoned by all True Necromancer summoning abilities. |
|  | True Aura Mastery | Improves the radius of the True Necrotic Aura. At max level this allows minions to survive even when outside the aura. Increases the chance of being refunded a soul when a minion dies within the aura by 15% per level. |
|  | Soul Reserve | Increases soul capacity by 5 per level. |
|  | Dark Sacrifice | A portion of the caster's life is sacrificed to generate a soul, starting at 75% at level 1 and ending at 25% at max level. |
