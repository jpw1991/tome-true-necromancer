# True Necromancer

This is a mod for Tales of Maj'Eyal that adds a new class to the game called
the `True Necromancer`. I was disappointed with the vanilla necromancer because
a summoning build is unfortunately quite weak. This mod seeks to address that issue.

This mod does not replace the Necromancer class. It simply adds a new class called the `True Necromancer` to the game.

## Brief Description

Unlike the vanilla Necromancer, the True Necromancer has fewer direct attacks of his own and has to rely on
his minions to deal damage. Without his minions, he is as helpless and pitiful. But with them, he's terrifying.

## Features

** Warning: The following may change as I balance the mod **

The class has no access to the following Necromancer talent categories:
- Animus
- Grave
- Necrotic Minions
- Nightfall
- Advanced Necrotic Minions
- Shades

These talents categories are replaced by the following ones:

| Type | Name | Locked | Talents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Name | Locked | Talent1 | Talent2 | Talent3 | Talent4 |
| Spell | Skeletal Minions | No | Summon Skeleton Warriors | Summon Skeleton Archers | Summon Skeleton Mages | Summon Lich |
| Spell | Fleshy Minions | No | Summon Ghouls | Summon Vampires | Summon Golem | Summon Wight |
| Spell | Dark Mastery | No | Minion Strength | True Aura Mastery | Soul Reserve | Dark Sacrifice |
| Spell | Dark Utility | Locked | Dark Recall | Minion Explosion | Necrotic Frenzy | Considerate Minions |
